-what happens if all operators leave channel?

===== NOTICE =====
-Check if user are kicked/banned to prevent send Notice message

===== PRVMSG =====
-Check if user are kicked/banned to prevent send Notice message
-I found some strange behavior, perhaps on the part of the client? if i send "/PRIVMSG user message" the message don't come with ":"

===== NICK =====
-When a user logs in with a nick already in use, they are notified,
when changing their current nick to another, they are not notified of the nick change because it is currently considered unregistered,
perhaps it would be okay to notify them of the change?
if ((client->getMemberLevel() & REGISTERED) == REGISTERED)
